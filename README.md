## Objective
Research in Data Clustering and Knowledge Graph
1. Typed topology and its application to dataset, accepted to Topology and Its Applications
   
   In this artcile, we study the data clustering problem from a general topological approach. Many topological concepts and/or structures can be used. In particular, the DBSCAN algorithm becomes the 
   type p closure in the setting of typed topological space, and a d dataset can navigate through branches.
   
2. First order logic system and typed topology on knowledge graph, in preparation

   A knowledge graph is currently expressed as a model of a first order logic language. However, there is not much study on such a language. The concept of typed topology can be considered as equal powerful in expressing the structure of a knowledge graph. Howwver, it provides additional methods and tools. In this research, we will investigate logic and topolofical structures of a knowledge graph using combined tools from the two areas.
